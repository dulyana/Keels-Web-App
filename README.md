# Keels-Web-App
The main objective of developing this project is to introduce a website for farmers to develop a market. This project is jointly launched by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) of Sri Lanka and Keels. Through this project, farmers can feed their produce and Keels staff can purchase them. Another important reason for developing this project is that farmers can sell their produce at any time they want. Also, the replacement of the traditional system with a computerized system. Keels buys crops directly from farmers so that profits can be made directly to farmers. In the traditional system, intermediaries make huge profits. This will enable farmers to sell their crops directly by breaking that indirect supply chain.
